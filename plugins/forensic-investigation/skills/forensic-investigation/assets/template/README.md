## The finding in one paragraph

<One dense paragraph. What happened, over what window, at what cost or impact,
how it was contained, and what remains unknown. Bold the key numbers.>

## Read in this order

| # | Document | What it gives you |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 0 | `POSTMORTEM.md` | The organisational read. **If you read nothing else, read this.** |
| 1 | `REPORT.md` | The findings, with evidence for each. |
| 2 | `TIMELINE.md` | Every event, timestamped and sourced. |
| 3 | `RECOMMENDATIONS.md` | What to do about it, with owners. |
| 4 | `INDICATORS.md` | Observables for detection and future responders. |
| 5 | `METHODOLOGY.md` | How the evidence was collected; limits of what it can support. |
| 6 | `CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY.md` | Who has held and verified the evidence, and when. |
| 7 | `CORRECTIONS.md` | Errors found in earlier revisions, recorded openly. |

## Layout

```text
<package-root>/
├── README.md              this file
├── POSTMORTEM.md          blameless organisational postmortem
├── REPORT.md              primary forensic report (findings F-01..)
├── TIMELINE.md            master timeline, every row cites evidence
├── RECOMMENDATIONS.md     actions R1.., each with its evidence
├── INDICATORS.md          observables and detection content
├── METHODOLOGY.md         method, integrity, confidence language, limitations
├── CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY.md    custody log, access log, verification log
├── CORRECTIONS.md         errata register (C-01..), never silent edits
├── evidence/              raw, unmodified captures + MANIFEST.md + SHA256SUMS
├── analysis/              derived tables only; no network calls to produce them
└── scripts/               collect / analyse / manifest — one script per hop
```

## Reproducing this

```text
<auth command>                 # read-only role, no elevation
./scripts/collect.sh           # raw captures into evidence/
./scripts/analyse.<ext>        # evidence/ -> analysis/  (no API calls)
./scripts/manifest.<ext>       # regenerates evidence/MANIFEST.md
(cd evidence && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```

Run in this order. Collection must finish before analysis so every derived
number traces to a hashed capture.

## What was and was not done

**Done:** <read-only collection of X, Y, Z; corroboration of each finding from two sources.>

**Not done:** <no configuration changes, no credential operations, no deletions — see METHODOLOGY §2.>

**Could not be done:** <what the evidence cannot support — see METHODOLOGY §7.>

## The three things most likely to be acted on wrongly

<!-- Name the misreadings you expect a reader to make. Each gets the
counter-evidence and a section reference. This section prevents bad decisions
made from a skim. -->

1. <Likely misreading.> <Why it is wrong, with the evidence and §-reference.>
2. <...>
3. <...>
